        <p>My name is Haoxi (pronounced How'she), or you can call me hash. I love technology, and have since I was a child. I believe that the world can be such a better place, if technology is used in the right way.</p>

        <p>I love hacking things. What does it have to do with doing good you ask? Hacking, unlike what Hollywood tells you, is an art. It is solving problems in creative ways, and making technology do what everyone else thought it couldn't or shouldn't.</p>

            <div class="article-section">
                <p>This year I have been tasked with creating a website that makes meaningful use of the State Library of Queensland datasets, along with a team of people in the course DECO1800 (Interactive Design) at UQ. It's quite a task, because the dataset is very old and has some serious issues with it such as missing links and silly spelling errors.</p>

                <div class="img-div"><img src="images/slq.png"></div>

                <p>Our initial idea is to use the newspaper photographs dataset, as it contained quite a lot of photos to work with as well as titles to newspaper articles in the period of WWI. We thought I would be fun to smudge out some words on the newspaper and make the user read the article to guess what it is from multiple choices.</p>

                <p>Our team consists of Lee the designer, Rine the writer, me the coder and Steven and Irene who are delegated with small front end development tasks due to their language barrier.</p>

                <a href="#inkedout">Back to top</a>
            </div>
        </section>

        <div>
            <a href="#inkedout-hack1" class="cmdtrigger" cmd="cat hack1" desc="How I worked around the old and broken dataset">
                <h2 class="listing" cmd="cat hack1">hack1</h2></a>
        </div>
        <section id="inkedout-hack1">
            <div class="article-section">
                <p>As soon as we started coding we hit the problem where the photos have no text on them. Being stubborn as I am, I decided to hack this thing together. So what have we got on the dataset for each row? </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>title</li>
                    <li>description</li>
                    <li>a photo that has no text (if the link wasn’t broken)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Ok, maybe that’s enough to search up the newspaper article that contains the photo on some other website. Then I discovered Trove — the treasure trove that we needed. It has every single page of the Queenslander newspaper archived from 1866, and even has OCR’ed text:</p>
                <div class="img-div"><img src="images/trovepage.png"></div>

                <p>Luckily Trove has an API that allows searching by keyword, and it returns a list of JSON objects including details of the matched articles:</p>
                <div class="img-div"><img src="images/api.png"></div>

                <p>The most useful bit is the troveUrl item. It leads us to the page above, where the article is displayed in all its splendour. But how do we get the text?</p>

                <p>It seems like there’s a download button, which leads to the rendered text (in HTML form) of the article.</p>
                <div class="img-div"><img src="images/download.png"></div>
                <div class="img-div"><img src="images/text.png"></div>

                <p>Now the challenge is to retrieve that text from the Trove URL, but in a program. It’s time for some magic. Notice that the URL of the article is:</p>
                <p><a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3523339">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3523339</a></p>
                <p>and the URL of the text is:</p>
                <p><a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/rendition/nla.news-article3523339.txt">https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/rendition/nla.news-article3523339.txt</a></p>


                <p>See how the number 3523339 is the same? That’s the id of the article. Get that, and the kingdom is ours.
                <br>
                The following PHP snippet is how I got the article id off the trove search results:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-php">
$troveResults = json_decode($troveResults, true);
$articleUrl = $troveResults["response"]["zone"][0]["records"]["article"][0]["url"];
//returns the string '/article/id'
$articleId = explode("/", $articleUrl)[2];
                </code></pre>

                <p>Now with the article id, we can pull the text down too:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-php">
$txtBaseUrl = "https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/rendition/nla.news-article";
$txtUrl = $txtBaseUrl . $articleId . ".txt";
$article = strip_tags(file_get_contents($txtUrl)); 
                </code></pre>

                <p>And voilà!</p>

        <section id="inkedout-hack2"><div class="article-section">
                <p>Now it’s smudging time! I’ve always been struggling with how to implement this properly, without the user being to just inspect element and cheat their way through our quiz. So CSS smudging is not an option.</p>

                <p>What about backend PHP smudging? This was actually way simpler than I thought:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-php">
                    //Choose a word, then replacing it with this bad boy does the job:
                    $smudge = '&lt;img src="images/smudge1.png" id="smudge"&gt;';
                    $modifiedText = preg_replace($wordPattern, $smudge, $origText, 1);
                </code></pre>

                <p>We first started off by just getting random articles and smudging out random words, and choosing three other words from the same article to form the multiple choice. The results weren’t that good: there were many articles with texts so bad that was barely readable, and the options sometimes were just random strings - since a “word” to my PHP script is just anything that was separated by a space.</p>
                <div class="img-div"><img id="smudge-img" src="images/smudge.png"></div>

                <p>That’s what we presented as our Minimum Viable Product — so there was quite a bit of feedback. The interface looked quite nice, but the biggest feedback was that it was meaningless — so many random words, unreadable articles, and the endless cycle of score grinding that the user gets nothing out of. The next challenge was adding meaning.</p>

                <a href="#inkedout">Back to top</a>

            </div>
        </section>

        <div>
            <a href="#inkedout-hack3" class="cmdtrigger" cmd="cat hack3" desc="Human intervention">
                <h2 class="listing" cmd="cat hack3">hack3</h2></a>
        </div>
        <section id="inkedout-hack3"><div class="article-section">

            <p>To add meaning to our website, we decided to focus on only one event, and having the articles that we use be in chronologically ordered reports of that event — the Gallipoli Campaign. Cos why not? It’s ANZAC 100 this year, so it’s a good matching theme. </p>

            <p>So the team retrieved from the API about a hundred of articles that came from the keyword “Gallipoli” (using the same method from Hack 1) and we read through them all to select out the relevant articles of good quality. At the end we came up with a selection of only six articles, each representing a certain stage of the campaign. The array of keywords below are what we used to search both SLQ (partly) for the matching images and Trove for the article text (instead of generating them randomly from the SLQ data).</p>

            <pre><code class="language-php">
$trove_keywords = array(
    "Forty-third Expeditionary Force number",
    "Our latest success",
    "From Gallipoli. Caption: Central News, photo. Caption: Returning from the trenches through a deep gully",
    "Captain Graham Butler, D.S.O., a Brisbane doctor, who has been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for bravery at the Dardanelles",
    "Anzac sentinel sunset";
    "The residential club for returned soldiers and sailors"
);
            </code></pre>

            <p>That itself wasn’t good enough; we needed to filter the options for the users as well. So yes, we hardcoded them after reading through the articles carefully to find quality words that invoke the most thinking.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-php">
//a list of good word options to smudge out, according to the same index in 
//trove_keywords
$smudge_words = array(
    array("Representatives", "Defence", "17229", "wounds", "front", "Egypt", 
        "Dardanelles", "seven"),
    array("Narrows", "Asiatic", "ROCKHAMPTON", "procession", "Chanak", "Photo"),
    array("Brevities", "Representative", "Metropolitan", "promotion", "instruction", "Lieutenant", "Tuckerman","Sergant"),
    array("BUTLER", "SCOTTISH", "BUNDABERG", "doctor", "bravery", "Dardanelles", "fighting",
        "wounded", "EGYPT"),
    array("lllustration", "Miscellaneous", "official", "trenches", "funnel", "entonnoir", "veteran", "sentinel", "captured"),
    array("letter", "rules", "secretary", "residential", "committee", "necessary", "knowledge")
);

            </code></pre>

            <p>Now that yielded a satisfying set of options! I also added a progress bar so that the user knows that they are making progress and it’s not endless. I learned first hand to make meaningful use of any data, manual reviews and tweaking of the output to the user is an important step, as data itself has little meaning without careful interpretation.</p>

            <div class="img-div"><img id="progress-img" src="images/progress.png"></div>

            <p>What’s the seventh question you ask? Isn’t there only 6? well, that’s the BOSS level which you have to arrange everything you read in chronological order. It was done in a rush and is confirmed almost impossible to complete. Of course, you can still try it <a target="_blank" href="https://u2f.interaction.courses">here</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <section id="inkedout-reflection"><div class="article-section">

            <p>This is my personal reflection on the project and the DECO1800 course at UQ as a whole.</p>

            <h2>The Journey</h2>

            <p>First of all a bit of context: I am currently studying at the University of Queensland as a first year Bachelor of IT student (as of 2018). In the first semester, which was half a year ago, I took some introductory programming courses such as CSSE1001, which was really easy due to my 3 years of programming experience back in high school. I also took DECO1100, which I really enjoyed due to the wisdom and humility as well as professionalism of Professor Ben Matthews, who challenged and stretched my critical thinking.</p>

            <p>That was a solid semester, but I was full of myself and thought it was boring. So this semester I took some of the most notoriously hard courses together just for fun, CSSE2002 and CSSE2310. That is my reason/excuse for being so occupied all the time and didn't have that much time to build my DECO1800 team properly. Keep it in mind as you read on.</p>

            <p>So in general, this course has been easy and a relaxing oasis compared to the intensity of the other courses I am taking this semester. Web programming wasn't hard for me, after taking DECO1400 and brushing up the quality of my front end coding. Since I was the leader throughout last semester in DECO1100 (Design thinking), I thought I would lead the team this time as well.</p>

            <p>But unlike last time, I didn't get to choose my team members. That wasn't good. I didn't see that coming, but hey, I have faith in God and he delivers. I was blessed with a really amazing documenter in my team, Rine, in whom I trusted the entirety of the documentations to and never had to worry a thing about what she had to finish. While she carried that part, I carried my digital cross of literally coding 90% of the website. Solid.</p>

            <p>We had pretty consistent team meetings every Friday, where me and Rine did most of the talking. Because not everyone on the team could speak Chinese (I didn't find out that Lee from Malaysia could until like week 4) I pretended to not know how to, and successfully did until I revealed to everyone half way into the term. I think that was a pretty bad move given that the two Chinese members of my team didn't know what was going on half of the time as much as I tried to explain it in English. We didn't really bond well, and I was a bit too afraid to delegate big tasks; the tiny coding assignments I have resulted in quite disappointed and messy snippets of code that took a while to fix. But I should've taught them more, so that they can take from this course more. I could have.</p>

            <p>I realised this towards the end of the semester, when it was a bit too late. I delegated the two Chinese members, Steven and Irene, the task of making a drag and drop interface in javascript so that I could implement the final boss level of the quiz. They happily took on the task, and delivered to me a half-working prototype of different divs with draggable numbers. Not too bad for a start! I got the idea and after a while of tweaking the final level was rushed together.</p>

            <h2>Expectations, reality and more expectations</h2>
            <p>Oh, look! It's my week 1 journal post!</p>
            <blockquote>
                <h3>What I know about this course?</h3>
                <p>Based on what I know about DECO1800, I expect to be doing some cool stuff this semester with a team of 4 people, building a website that utilizes data from the State Library of Queensland to educate/inform/entertain. On the coding side there will be some PHP and JavaScript (both front & back end)</p>

                <h3>Personal learning goals?</h3>
                <p>I want to learn some more team building and leadership skills. I was the team leader through the DECO1100 course last semester and will remain so.</p>

                <h3>Worries?</h3>
                <p>I’m worried about using too much JavaScript and making a really heavy website with slow load times, and being forced to do so.</p>

                <h3>Hopes & dreams?</h3>
                <p>I hope that I can work well with my team and get something really cool done.</p>

                <h3>Expectations?</h3>
                <p>I expect this course to be just as fun, engaging and challenging as DECO1100 last semester. I expect having lots of freedom in the development of the project so that cool ideas can be materialized, and that it will not be easy but will push and stretch each person in the course including myself. So bring it on :)</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Wasn't that cute... Some expectations were indeed met, but the course in general was not as good as I expected it to be. It was definitely fun; less so challenging, and definitely not as engaging the studios I had last semester in design thinking. In 1100 we had stand ups every 10-20 minutes asking team members to present some of their ideas and reflections on particular things, and I think that's a really good thing to do to keep team members on track with what to do and what's going on. I also loved how every "zone"(2-3 teams) had a dedicated tutor that would look after us in detail. I think that's something the tutors can try to do in this course.</p>

            <p>Oh and the dataset was horrible, in case you missed that in hack1 and hack2. But hey, I wouldn't need to be hacky otherwise.</p>

            <p>I think I missed by personal learning goal. I was too focused on the product and outcome itself I almost stopped caring about my team. Well, I was very generous with encouragement and lollies, but not tasks to empower them to take part and learn more coding. If there are any takeaways in that regard through this course, it would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speak their language if you can, and build good relationships with your teammates</li>
                <li>Let your teammates do more just to learn, if it was bad you can always ask them to change it / fix it yourself later. The point is to empower.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>More Feedback</h2>

            <p>Matt, if you are reading this, you are an awesome lecturer. Your slides are always so professionally and humorously made, your delivery is always so clear and your vibe makes a good designer. Your voice was so soothing in DECO1400 lectures that I deliberately skipped them so I don't fall asleep.</p>

            <p>This is a decent first year course. APIs are no doubt used everywhere, and getting some backend coding taught to students is crucial and beneficial for everyone. The course provided a great platform for students to freely express their creativity through design and code, which is pretty cool. It enabled some teams of third year students to really take their time to shine, inspire and dominate everyone else (yes you know who I'm talking about)</p>

            <p>I also earnestly, earnestly encourage letting people choose their own team and do peer reviews. I think peer reviews are not suppose to be the last resort of bad contribution, but its purpose is to make everyone do their part and ensure good communication with their team.</p>

            <p>Now let's talk about some more hacking. This time it's hardcore hacking, in the field of infosec (information security). I have always felt a passion for this field, not only because it is so intriguing and curious, but also for the thrill of mastery and sense of control when a computer listens to you wholeheartedly.</p>

            <p>The practise of penetration testing - or pentesting - is the ethical term used for gaining unauthorised access to systems and networks with permission. It is done to find out where the holes and gaps are, so that someone with true malicous and destructive intent cannot easily do the same.</p>

            <div class="img-div"><img src="images/offsec.png"></div>

            <p>Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) is the world’s first hands on penetration testing certificate. Challengers need to have sound knowledge and skills regarding security and are challenged to compromise 5 different systems in 24 hours (a mix of Windows and *nix) and gain the highest privilege. Their motto is “Try Harder!”</p>

            <h2>Materials & The Lab</h2>

            <p>In order to take the OSCP exam you have to take the PWK(Penetration Testing With Kali Linux) course offered by offsec. The material includes a detail PDF and an archive of video tutorials on different topics. The topics include linux command line, port scaning, service enumeration, metasploit, buffer overflow, using exploits, web app hacking, privilege escalation and report writing etc. Don't worry if any of this sound like Matrix to you - these things are widely covered on the internet and is only a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=penestration+testing+tutorial">google search</a> away!</p>

            <p>The thing that stands out in the course is offsec’s online lab. This is a VPN that has more than 50 machines and 4 subnets for students for freely practise their skills in.</p>

            <p>Since I am a poor student, I bought the 30 day lab package that includes the course materials and then added 15 days last holiday (that’s 800+150=900USD, so about 1180AUD). It can be costly but the things that you learn and experience in the course plus a renowned cyber certificate is definitely worth more than what you pay. I only needed 45 days because I have previous experience on Linux and hacking; for a beginner I would recommend 60-90 days in the lab. More detailed information about the course can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I was super excited (and scared) the week before the exam. Although I did a lot of preparations, looking at other student’s either intimidating or frightening write ups made me feel like it’s never enough. After my lab time was over (which was a month ago) I mainly practised by attacking virtual machines on vulnhub.com. I booked the exam a bit late so all the weekends are gone for like 3 months, and stacking up on my busy uni schedule I had to book it on a Tuesday morning. The things I did on the night before the exam was pray, and pray, and pray ...</p>

            <p>The exam was to start at 7 in the morning, but somehow I woke up at 3:45. Looking out the window into the sleeping Brisbane downtown, I continued praying. God spoke to me at this moment, whispering the words “The victory is yours.” and again, “The victory is yours.” Reassured, I was about to get back to sleep when the Holy Spirit prompted me again this time, repeating: “Get up and get ready.” Never have I experienced this in my life, so clearly and urgently. I obeyed.</p>

            <p>I got out of bed, took out my bulky laptop for the exam (8GB RAM, i7 and GTX 970M) and booted up my Ubuntu box with a bunch of pentest tools (installed from a <a href="https://github.com/madmantm/ubuntu-pentest-tools" target="_blank">script on github</a>). However this setup is not too convenient, as all the tools are in different folders and not all of them are on the system's PATH. I realized God’s reason for waking me up — I should install the Kali Linux virtual machine, which I neglected to do. An hour later it finally finished torrenting and installing. Being the careless person I am without God’s help I would’ve wasted so much time in the exam. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Then I went back to sleep til right before 7.</p>

            <p>The full mark of the exam is 100, with 70 needed to pass, and the 5 machines differ in points according to difficulty. I started with the buffer overflow machine,  and after a harsh 2 hours I scribbled half a page of weird memory addresses on paper and a page of Python exploit code, but the shellcode just kept crashing for whatever reason. I decided to take a break, playing some worship songs on guitar and pray. Then miraculously the Spirit put the words on my mind to type into the search bar — and half an hour later I gained my first 25 points. The combination of overwhelming pride, joy and thankfullness simpy cannot be fully described with words.</p>

            <p>After this machine time flew past me, as reverse shells popped into my terminal one by one. At around 3pm I already rooted 3 machines and have limited access to the fourth (which means no full marks for that box). Exhausted, I decided to take a nap.. But I didn’t last half an hour before climbing out of bed and keeping on hacking 🤦🏻‍♂️ Just before 6pm I finally rooted the fourth box, gaining a solid 80 points. Sadly I couldn’t wrap my head around the fifth and hit the hay at 1am, until 7 the next day.</p>

            <p>The actual exam time allowance is 23 hours and 45 minutes, then the student is allowed 24 hours to write and submit their report with detailed steps of attacks and screenshots. I used the OSCP report template (for libreoffice), and surprisingly the results came up the next night… After seeing the notification on my phone I could hardly breath, my heart raced and my hands were shaking as I opened the email…</p>
